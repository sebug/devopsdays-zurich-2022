## The Socio-Technical Path to High-Performing Teams Charity Majors
The happiness and satisfaction of your users and your engineers tend to rise
and fall in tandem.

6570 times faster lead time from commit to deploy.

Only hire from the best schools - stupid

Your productivity tends to rise or fall to match that of the team you join.

Three elements of the sociotechnical system

 - Your Team
 - Your Tools
 - Production

=> Feedback Loops

CI is only the appetizer.

CD as in Continuous Deployment!

15 minutes to prod is nice, but it's more important that it's predictable.

Undeployed software ages like fine milk.

## GitOps for the People Lian Li
Never speak to management when addressing delivery pains:

- Quality Assurance (testers manually deploy on the test environment)
- Diverting environments
- Compliance

Suggestions:

- QA -> Automated Testing, also, embed them
- Diverting environments -> Kubernetes
- Compliance -> GitOps

Manual process: they were first looking at stuff that noone really wanted to do.

The ops team only has to approve the pull request, then it goes to prod.

JiraOps! Ticket-driven delivery.
